hello worlds printed -done
draw and spwaning function used -done

3rd example; 
    update individually -done
    if the rect goes beyond the borders, try to spawn new rect object; - done
    player class will be added -done
    firing mechanism with space key
    collision detection will be added (rectangle- circle collision detection)



general usage :
. more object usage
. class usage.
. try to use more computition.



now; collision detection not effective. bullet, player and rect mechanism works well.
